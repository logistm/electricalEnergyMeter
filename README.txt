This master thesis describes the development of smart electricity energy meter on the ARM
platform. In general, the commercial electrical energy meters are measuring only the total
active energy, therefore, users cannot also monitor other important power consumption
parameters. The goal of this thesis is to develop a prototype of smart ARM based energy
meter, which is capable to measure several power consumption parameters and display
them on a webpage in real-time. In the thesis the complete design of the ARM based smart
energy meter is presented in detail. Further, the development of user interface for
displaying measured data on the webpage in real-time is also presented. These results are
presented both in textual and graphical form. Additionally, the theory of electric power
consumption measurements and some commercial energy meters are presented.
